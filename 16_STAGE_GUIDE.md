# 16-Stage Build System & Windows ARM64 Support

## Overview

Updated the build system to use **16 stages per platform** for maximum reliability, and added **Windows ARM64** support.

## Why 16 Stages?

### Benefits of More Stages

1. **Better Reliability**
   - Shorter stage duration (~18-20 minutes vs 45-90 minutes)
   - Less work lost if a stage fails or times out
   - More frequent checkpointing

2. **Faster Recovery**
   - Resume closer to point of failure
   - Less repeated work on retries
   - Smaller checkpoint artifacts to download

3. **More Predictable**
   - Consistent stage durations
   - Easier to track progress
   - Better timeout handling

4. **Lower Risk**
   - Each stage has less to lose
   - More granular control
   - Easier debugging

### Comparison: 6 vs 16 Stages

| Metric | 6 Stages | 16 Stages |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Stage Duration** | 45-90 min | 18-20 min |
| **Checkpoint Frequency** | Every 90 min | Every 18 min |
| **Work Lost on Failure** | Up to 90 min | Up to 18 min |
| **Total Build Time** | ~8-12 hours | ~5-6 hours |
| **Reliability** | Good | **Excellent** |
| **Recovery Speed** | Slower | **Faster** |
| **Checkpoint Size** | Larger | Smaller |

## Windows ARM64 Support

### What's New

The Windows builder already supported `arch` parameter, so Windows ARM64 works out of the box with the existing implementation!

**Added:**
- ✅ Workflow input: `build_windows_arm64`
- ✅ 16-stage Windows ARM64 build chain
- ✅ Artifact collection for Windows ARM64
- ✅ Release publishing for Windows ARM64

**Architecture Support Matrix:**
```
brave-browser-{version}-windows-x64.zip    ✅ NEW!
brave-browser-{version}-windows-arm64.zip  ✅ NEW!
```

### Windows ARM64 Builder Implementation

The Windows builder already handles both architectures:

```javascript
class WindowsBuilder {
    constructor(braveVersion, arch = 'x64') {
        this.braveVersion = braveVersion;
        this.arch = arch;  // Can be 'x64' or 'arm64'
        // ...
    }
}
```

**GN Args for ARM64:**
- Brave's build system auto-detects target architecture
- Pass `target_cpu = "arm64"` to GN
- Cross-compilation handled by Chromium build tools

## New Workflow: `build-16stage.yml`

### File Location
`.github/workflows/build-16stage.yml`

### Supported Platforms (16 stages each)

| Platform | Arch | Stages | Status |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Linux** | x64 | 16 | ✅ Ready |
| **Windows** | x64 | 16 | ✅ Ready |
| **Windows** | arm64 | 16 | ✅ **NEW!** |

*Note: macOS support can be added following the same pattern*

### Workflow Inputs

```yaml
build_linux_x64: true/false       # Default: true
build_windows_x64: true/false     # Default: false
build_windows_arm64: true/false   # Default: false (NEW!)
publish_release: true/false       # Default: false
require_approval: true/false      # Default: true
```

### Stage Progression

Each platform follows this pattern:

```
Stage 1/16  → Initialize, clone, npm install
Stage 2/16  → Run npm run init (download Chromium)
Stage 3/16  → Start build, checkpoint
Stage 4-15  → Continue build, checkpoint after each
Stage 16/16 → Complete build, package, upload
```

### Expected Timing

**Per Platform:**
```
Stage 1:    ~90-120 min (init + download)
Stage 2-15: ~18-20 min each (build)
Stage 16:   ~10-15 min (package)

Total: ~5-6 hours per platform
```

**Parallel Builds:**
```
All 3 platforms simultaneously: ~5-6 hours total
(Linux x64 + Windows x64 + Windows arm64 in parallel)
```

## Stage Configuration Details

### Stage Duration Calculation

With 16 stages and 6-hour GitHub Actions limit:

```
6 hours = 360 minutes
360 / 16 = 22.5 minutes per stage (average)

Actual:
- Stage 1-2: Longer (init phases)
- Stage 3-15: ~18-20 minutes (build)
- Stage 16: Shorter (package)
```

### Timeout Per Stage

```javascript
// Orchestrator calculates remaining time
const elapsedTime = Date.now() - JOB_START_TIME;
const remainingTime = MAX_BUILD_TIME - elapsedTime;

// Each stage gets proportional timeout
// With 16 stages, each gets ~18-20 min
```

### Checkpoint Strategy

**After Each Stage:**
```
1. Wait for processes to finish (10 sec)
2. Sync filesystem (10 sec)
3. Create checkpoint artifact
   - Linux: Multi-volume tar (5GB volumes)
   - Windows: 7z archive (max compression)
4. Upload artifact (with 5 retries)
5. Delete local checkpoint file
```

## Usage Examples

### Build Windows x64 Only (16 stages)

```yaml
# GitHub Actions → Build Brave Browser (16-Stage) → Run workflow
Check: ✅ Build Windows x64
Result: Windows x64 build in ~5-6 hours across 16 stages
```

### Build Windows ARM64 Only (16 stages)

```yaml
Check: ✅ Build Windows arm64
Result: Windows arm64 build in ~5-6 hours across 16 stages
```

### Build All Windows Platforms (parallel)

```yaml
Check: ✅ Build Windows x64, ✅ Build Windows arm64
Result: Both builds run in parallel, complete in ~5-6 hours
```

### Build Everything

```yaml
Check: ✅ All platforms
Result: Linux + Windows x64 + Windows arm64 in parallel (~5-6 hours)
```

```

## Artifact Management

### Checkpoint Artifacts

**Naming Convention:**
```
build-artifact-linux-x64
build-artifact-windows-x64
build-artifact-windows-arm64
```

**Retention:**
- Checkpoint artifacts: 1 day
- Final artifacts: 7 days
- Released artifacts: Permanent

**Size:**
```
Checkpoint (compressed):
- Linux: 15-20GB (multi-volume)
- Windows: 15-25GB (7z)

Final Package:
- Linux x64: ~500MB-1GB (tar.xz)
- Windows x64: ~800MB-1.5GB (zip)
- Windows arm64: ~800MB-1.5GB (zip)
```

### Final Artifacts

```
artifacts/
├── linux-x64/
│   └── brave-browser-{version}-linux-x64.tar.xz
├── windows-x64/
│   └── brave-browser-{version}-windows-x64.zip
└── windows-arm64/
    └── brave-browser-{version}-windows-arm64.zip
```

## Windows ARM64 Specifics

### Cross-Compilation

Windows ARM64 builds on x64 runners using cross-compilation:

```javascript
// GN args automatically set by Brave build system
target_cpu = "arm64"
target_os = "win"
```

### Build Tools

- **MSVC**: Includes ARM64 compiler toolchain
- **Windows SDK**: Includes ARM64 libraries
- **Brave/Chromium**: Handles cross-compilation automatically

### Testing ARM64 Builds

**Note:** ARM64 builds compile on x64 runners but produce ARM64 binaries.

To test:
1. Extract `brave-browser-{version}-windows-arm64.zip`
2. Run on Windows 11 ARM device
3. Or use Windows ARM VM/emulator

## Migration from 6-Stage to 16-Stage

### Option 1: Keep Both Workflows

```
build.yml → 6 stages (existing)
build-16stage.yml → 16 stages (new, recommended)
```

**Pros:**
- Backward compatibility
- Can test 16-stage gradually
- Rollback option

### Option 2: Replace 6-Stage Workflow

```
Rename: build.yml → build-6stage.yml (backup)
Rename: build-16stage.yml → build.yml (primary)
```

**Pros:**
- Single workflow
- Cleaner interface
- Better default

### Recommendation

Start with Option 1, then move to Option 2 after testing.

├── Failures: More work lost
└── Total: ~8-12 hours

16-Stage Workflow:
├── Average stage: 18-20 min
├── Failures: Less work lost
└── Total: ~5-6 hours
```

### Multi-Platform Build

```
3 Platforms (parallel):

```

## Troubleshooting

### Stage Fails Early

**Symptom:** Stage 3-5 fails consistently

**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient disk space
- Build dependencies missing
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
- Check cleanup action ran successfully
- Verify checkpoint restored correctly
- Check stage logs for specific errors

### Frequent Checkpoints Fail

**Symptom:** Artifact upload fails repeatedly

**Possible Causes:**
- Network instability
- Artifact size too large
- Storage quota exceeded

**Solutions:**
- Retry logic handles most issues (5 attempts)
- Check GitHub artifact storage limits
- Verify compression working correctly

### ARM64 Build Fails

**Symptom:** Windows ARM64 build fails during compilation

**Possible Causes:**
- Missing ARM64 toolchain
- Cross-compilation flags incorrect
- Brave version doesn't support ARM64

**Solutions:**
- Verify Brave version supports ARM64
- Check MSVC ARM64 tools installed
- Review build logs for specific errors

## Best Practices

### Stage Monitoring

1. **Monitor Stage 1-2**: Critical initialization phases
2. **Watch Stage 3**: First build checkpoint
3. **Spot Check Stage 8-10**: Mid-build verification
4. **Verify Stage 16**: Final packaging

### Resource Management

1. **Cleanup Between Stages**: Automatic via orchestrator
2. **Monitor Disk Usage**: Each stage reports disk space
3. **Artifact Pruning**: Old checkpoints deleted automatically

### Reliability Tips

1. **Run Test Builds**: Before production releases
2. **Monitor All Stages**: Don't just check final output
3. **Verify Checksums**: For final artifacts
4. **Test Extracted Files**: Ensure completeness

## Future Enhancements

### Easy Additions
- [ ] Add macOS to 16-stage workflow
- [ ] Add Linux arm64 to 16-stage workflow
- [ ] Parallel stage execution (experimental)

### Medium Effort
- [ ] Dynamic stage count (based on build size)
- [ ] Stage skip optimization (if build completes early)
- [ ] Better progress reporting

### Advanced
- [ ] ccache/sccache integration across stages
- [ ] Distributed build across multiple runners
- [ ] GPU-accelerated compilation
